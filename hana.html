        <h1>THE DISPLACED: HANA</h1>
        <h2>At 12, she has lived one-quarter of her life as a Syrian refugee in Lebanon.</h2>

      <p class="firstGraph">Hana Abdullah, a 12-year-old girl from Syria, last saw her home three years ago. So long ago, in the life of a girl her age, that she's forgotten as much as she remembered. It is almost certainly rubble now, a pile of rocks burying all they left behind: Hana’s favorite doll, dressed like a queen, with long hair down to her waist; the crystal glasses the family rarely used; the proper mattresses; the flush toilet.</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <p class="firstGraph">At 4:45 in the morning on a Saturday in early August, stars were still bright in the sky above a refugee settlement in rural Lebanon where Hana now lives. Hana slept on her bamboo mat by the edge of her family’s tent. Then she was up, vertical in one swift movement, stretching, pulling on a hat from a stash of her belongings. She grabbed lunch — a tomato, and a pita she folded around a potato — and ducked outside to wait on one of the benches in front of her tent.</p>

    <div class="section" id="hthirdPhoto" class="photo">
    <h4 class="whiteHanaTypeLeft">Hana worked in the nearby fields of Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, picking fruits or vegetables, and everyone started early. At 5:45, they arrived at the field.</h4>

  <div class="section" id="textFrame3">
    <div class="intro">
      <p class="firstGraph">Hana walked up and down the rows of cucumbers, collecting from the pickers. When her crate was full — it sometimes weighed 20 pounds or more — she carried it on her bony shoulder, to where it would be sorted. But with every trip, the temperature rose, the trek grew longer.</p>
      <p>Hana's father remembers when he was land owner who had employees working the fields. Now his children are forced to do that work.</p>

    <h4 class="blackTypeLeft">By midmorning, Hana’s shoulder and back ached, and she was thirsty — there was never enough water.</h4>

    <div class="section" id="textFrame4">
      <div class="intro">
        <p class="firstGraph">Hana's family left Syria by bus. When they reached the border, traffic was at a standstill. From the bus, she heard more gunshots and looked outside. She remembers seeing men firing back and forth with Syrian soldiers. Then suddenly she was in the bus driver’s arms, and he was running, carrying her away from the bus with its full tank of gas. Outside, bullets were flying, and before she understood what was happening, she was climbing into a giant cement pipe along with two of her siblings and her mother, all of them cramped in the dark, unable to move, everyone howling or sobbing.</p>

        <p class="firstGraph">“It would have been better to die in our home than die like this,” she screamed at her mother. “Why did you bring us here?” They ran to an abandoned building to wait out the shooting; how long it lasted, she could not say. That day, her life as a refugee began. She entered a new world, and she never stopped wishing she could return to the old one.</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <p class="firstGraph">When Hana thought about the future, no clear image emerged: She found it too painful to try to hope for a return to life in Syria. But she did not think much about her future in Lebanon, either.</p>
      <p>Hana liked to imagine that she might become a doctor one day, but if her family remained in the settlement for another few years, it seemed very likely that she, too, would be married there, maybe even raise children there, instead of dreaming of college or medical school. Her childhood was in a desperate, losing race with the war: Which would be finished first?</p>
