        <p class="firstGraph">Oleg Teryokhin was living in Nikishino, a rural village in eastern Ukraine, when fighting broke out in April 2014. Hastily formed separatist militias, goaded and armed by Moscow, rose up in a rebellion against a new, pro-Western government in Kiev. In July, scorched scraps of clothing and bits of paper with foreign writing blew through the village — debris from the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the passenger jet that was shot down, killing hundreds of people whose bodies lay in fields just south of the village. Oleg, then 10, carried some of these items home to his mother, Galina.</p>

        <p class="firstGraph">A few weeks later, she and Oleg fled, seeking shelter elsewhere in Ukraine. Oleg’s father, Aleksandr, a coal miner, stayed to tend to Galina’s elderly father but eventually was forced to leave and join his wife and son.</p> 
        <p>As cease-fire talks halted the worst of the fighting in February, Oleg’s family, along with a few dozen others, returned to the village. They discovered her father’s body in the backyard of his house. He had probably been killed by shrapnel and had lain frozen outside for months. “Before the war, I visited him every day,” Oleg, now 11, said. “Now I visit his grave.”</p>

He still speeds around the village on his bicycle with his friends, roaming this no man’s land.</p>
