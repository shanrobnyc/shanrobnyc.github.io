        <p class="firstGraph"> Oleg Teryokhin was living with his mother and father in Nikishino, a rural village of fewer than 1,000 coal miners, farmers and their families in eastern Ukraine, when fighting broke out in April 2014. Hastily formed separatist militias, goaded and armed by Moscow, rose up in a rebellion against a new, pro-Western government in Kiev. In the first months of the conflict, the fighting was far from Nikishino, and Oleg, then 10, spent the early summer tearing about the village on his bicycle, zipping past its old brick cottages and apricot orchards. Then, in July, scorched scraps of clothing and bits of paper with foreign writing blew through the village — debris from the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the passenger jet that was shot down, killing hundreds of people whose bodies lay in fields just south of the village. When Oleg carried some of these items home, his mother, Galina, was horrified that the conflict had come so close.</p>

        <p class="firstGraph">For weeks, he and his grandmother swam and waded through snake-infested waters, dodging crocodiles, eating little more than grass. Chuol was constantly afraid that he might die. If a soldier did not kill him, he thought, an animal surely would.</p>
        <p>“We would swim for so long until we could swim no more,” he recalled. “But we could sometimes still hear the gunfire and needed to keep moving. So we pulled ourselves along by the reeds.”</p>

        <p class="firstGraph">When Chuol arrived on this small island in the swamp, joining tens of thousands of others who fled the fighting, he often liked to be by himself. Gradually, he made friends.</p>
       <p>Most afternoons, he played soccer. ‘‘When I score a goal, I do like I have seen Chelsea players do on television,’’ he said. ‘‘I run to the corner, and all my teammates will come run up to me and hug me and congratulate me.’’</p>

     <h4>Chuol’s grandmother said that while Chuol puts on a brave face, the pain is never far from his thoughts. ‘‘He tells me: ‘Let’s go back, and maybe we can find my mother. I want to go back. I don’t care if I die.’ ’’</h4>

When it rains, sometimes they send the boys to sleep in the school.’’</p>
