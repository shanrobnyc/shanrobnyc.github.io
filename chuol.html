        <h1>THE DISPLACED: CHUOL</h1>
        <h2>At 9, without his parents, he was forced to flee to the swamps.</h2>

    <div class="intro">
      <p class="firstGraph"> One night in May, 2013, the fighting in South Sudan came to Chuol’s village. He was only 7. He remembers every terrifying detail. Women were raped and men murdered. His father and grandfather were herded into a small hut and burned alive. With his mother and grandmother, Chuol fled into the swamp. In the chaos, his mother ran in another direction, and they lost her. For months they did not know if she was dead or alive.</p>

    <h4 class="blackTypeRight">“When I was holding onto a reed in the water, my feet not able to touch the ground, I would think I could die at any time if a crocodile came and got me,” Chuol remembers.</h4>

  <div class="section" id="textFrame2">
    <div class="intro">
      <p class="firstGraph">For weeks, he and his grandmother swam and waded through snake-infested waters, dodging crocodiles, eating little more than grass. Chuol was constantly afraid that he might die. If a soldier did not kill him, he thought, an animal surely would. “We would swim for so long until we could swim no more,” he recalled. “But we could sometimes still hear the gunfire and needed to keep moving. So we pulled ourselves along by the reeds.”</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <p class="firstGraph">When Chuol arrived on this small island in the swamp, joining tens of thousands of others who fled the fighting, he often liked to be by himself. Gradually, he made friends. Most afternoons, he played soccer. ‘‘When I score a goal, I do like I have seen Chelsea players do on television,’’ he said. ‘‘I run to the corner, and all my teammates will come run up to me and hug me and congratulate me.’’</p>

    <h4>Chuol’s grandmother said that while Chuol puts on a brave face, the pain is never far from his thoughts. ‘‘He tells me: ‘Let’s go back, and maybe we can find my mother. I want to go back. I don’t care if I die.’ ’’</h4>

    <div class="section" id="textFrame4">
      <div class="intro">
        <p class="firstGraph">Chuol lives with three dozen children and a half-dozen women in a small wood-and-mud hut with a fenced-in dirt yard of about 150 square feet. ‘‘With all the crowding, sometimes I wish I had my own space,’’ Chuol said. ‘‘When it is not raining, we will sleep in the yard, and the women will sleep in the hut. When it rains, sometimes they send the boys to sleep in the school.’’</p>

        <h4 class= "whiteTypeLeft">When Unicef was finally able to reach this village, the first thing it did was set up a ‘‘child-friendly space’’ — a place where children can play, take school lessons and, most important, feel secure. </h4>

        <p class="firstGraph">Chuol’s grandmother is planning to go back to South Sudan to look for his mother. Unicef has received reports that she has been seen alive in the country. When I spoke to Chuol this past summer, he was still on the island in the swamp. “If I grow up and leave this place,” he said, “maybe I can still become a doctor.”</p>
